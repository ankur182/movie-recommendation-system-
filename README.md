The system works like this:

1.Data Preparation: We start by loading the movie data from a CSV file.
2.Calculating Similarities: Using the ratings given by users, we calculate the correlation between each pair of movies.
3.Filtering: We filter out movies with low ratings to ensure reliable recommendations.
4.Prediction: When you provide a movie name, our system finds movies that are highly correlated with it, suggesting the top 5 similar movies.

5.Verification: To ensure accuracy, you can check the suggested movies on platforms like Google or IMDb.

"Upon trying out our movie recommendation system with the movie 'Titanic,' I was impressed by the accuracy of the suggested films. Notably, when I checked 'The Abyss' on Google, its connection to 'Titanic' was apparent, validating the reliability of our system."

The goal is to make your movie-watching experience more enjoyable by offering tailored recommendations. Give it a try and let us know what you think!
